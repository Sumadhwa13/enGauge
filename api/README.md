# IMPORTANT

This requires [this server](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html) as a backend running on port 9000 to run properly

Once StanfordCoreNLP 4.2.0 has been installed and extracted, run the server according to their directions and then run `python3 api.py` to start the backend Flask server.
